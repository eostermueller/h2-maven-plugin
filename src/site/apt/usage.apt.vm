Usage

* Summary

 The <<<h2-maven-plugin>>> is a standard Maven plugin that helps with
 unit- and integration-testing database-related projects that need to
 interact with the {{{http://h2database.com/html/main.html}H2
 database}}.  Install it and use it like other standard Maven plugins.

* Installation

 Install the plugin as you would any other Maven plugin.  In your
 <<<<build>>>>'s <<<<plugins>>>> stanza, include a <<<<plugin>>>>
 element referencing the <<<h2-maven-plugin>>>:

+---+
  <plugin>
    <groupId>com.github.eostermueller</groupId>
    <artifactId>jpa-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${projectVersion}</version>
    <!-- ...more to come. -->
  </plugin>
+---+

* Goal selection

 Please see the {{{./plugin-info.html}Goals}} page for more
 details on individual goals.

** <<<h2:spawn>>>

 Spawns a new instance of an H2 TCP server in a separate process.
 This process will continue to run until it is correctly and
 appropriately stopped (often by using the <<<h2:stop>>> goal).

 This goal binds by default to the <<<pre-integration-test>>> phase.

 Here is an example of configuring the plugin to run this goal using
 the defaults:

+---
   <plugin>
     <groupId>com.github.eostermueller</groupId>
     <artifactId>jpa-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     <version>${projectVersion}</version>
     <executions>
       <execution>
         <id>Spawn a new H2 TCP server</id>
         <goals>
           <goal>spawn</goal>
         </goals>
       </execution>
     </executions>
   </plugin>
+---

** <<<h2:stop>>>

 Stops a running H2 TCP server.  The server need not have been started
 via the <<<h2:spawn>>> goal.

 This goal binds by default to the <<<post-integration-test>>> phase.

 Here is an example of configuring the plugin to run this goal using
 the defaults:

+---
   <plugin>
     <groupId>com.github.eostermueller</groupId>
     <artifactId>jpa-maven-plugin</artifactId>
     <version>${projectVersion}</version>
     <executions>
       <execution>
         <id>Stop a running H2 TCP server</id>
         <goals>
           <goal>stop</goal>
         </goals>
       </execution>
     </executions>
   </plugin>
